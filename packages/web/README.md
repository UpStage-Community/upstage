# Overview
This is the web output using react-native-web. It uses the @upstage/common package located within this monorepo.

# Running Locally
Go to @upstage/common and run `yarn dev` to compile and watch for changes. Most changes will need to happen there, as they affect both web and app.

In another terminal, go to @upstage/web and run `yarn dev` to compile and watch for changes. It will launch the output in your browser under localhost:3000
