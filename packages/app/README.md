# Overview
This is the ios/android app.

# Running Locally
Go to @upstage/common and run `yarn dev` to compile and watch for changes. Most changes will need to happen there, as they affect both web and app.

In another terminal, go to @upstage/app and run `yarn start` to build a dependency graph.
In yet another terminal, go to @upstage/app and run `yarn ios` to build the ios app.
